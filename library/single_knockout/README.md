1. One single KO in-silico library was created based on 16 carbon sources optional metabolites.
This library was used to benchmark against the iML1515 experimental data.

The following prediction result table show the accuracy of the logic encoding
|---> TP: 2394, FP: 969, FN: 1695, TN: 18559
|---> Recall: 0.5854732208363903
|---> Precision: 0.711864406779661
|---> Accuracy: 0.8871998983782868

2. An additional KO library was created to draw insights of single knockout effects in AAA media
We used this in-silico library as reference when selecting double-knockout gene pair candidates.
